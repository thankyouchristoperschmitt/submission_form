          died suddenly in our home yesterday. Natural causes, not COVID, still
          waiting on an official cause of death. One thing I do know is how much
          he loved so many of you, and how happy he was to help others or to
          make them laugh. More later.

        <h2>
          Let&rsquo;s collect everyone&rsquo; best memories of Christopher and share them.
        </h2>

        <p>
          We&rsquo;d like to <em>thank</em> Christopher for everything he did. He did
          a lot of incredible things that helped a lot of people. This site is
          being built by friends of Christopher who also worked in the web
          industry with him. Christopher did a lot for the web community, so many
          of our memories are about that. That&rsquo;s great! This site is inclusive for
          everyone that loved Christopher, so let&rsquo;s write our memories
          such that anyone could understand and appreciate them, whether you&rsquo;re
          someone who works on websites or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          After we&rsquo;ve collected everyone&rsquo;s memories, we&rsquo;ll build out a beautiful
          site from those memories all together to share with friends and
          family.
        </p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;re OK with publicly sharing the memory, please do below.</p>
