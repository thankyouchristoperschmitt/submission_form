          died suddenly in our home yesterday. Natural causes, not COVID, still
          waiting on an official cause of death. One thing I do know is how much
          he loved so many of you, and how happy he was to help others or to
          make them laugh. More later.

          Let's collect everyone's best memories of Christopher and share them.
        </h2>

        <p>
          We'd like to <em>thank</em> Christopher for everything he did. He did
          a lot of incredible things that helped a lot of people. This site is
          being built by friends of Christopher who also worked in the web
          industry with him. Christopher did a lot for the web industry, so many
          of our memories are about that. That's great! This site is for
          everyone that loved Christopher though, so let's write our memories
          such that anyone could understand and appreciate them, whether you're
          someone who works on websites or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          After we've collected everyone's memories, we'll built out a beautiful
          site from those memories all together to share with friends and
          family.
        </p>

        <p>If you're OK with publicly sharing the memory, please do below.</p>
